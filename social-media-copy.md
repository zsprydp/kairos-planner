# Kairos Planner - Social Media Copy

## Instagram/Facebook Post (Long)

### Option 1 - The Honest One
Can I be honest? I love our slow, book-rich days. I love morning time with tea and hymns and everyone piled on the couch.

But the planning? The keeping track of where we are in six different books for three different kids? The "wait, did we already do that chapter?" moments?

That part was stealing my peace.

So I built something. It's called Kairos - because I needed to stop living in chaos and start living in the unhurried moments.

It's free right now while I'm still making it better. If you want to try it, link is in bio. No pressure, no credit card, just a tool that finally gets how we actually homeschool.

### Option 2 - The Shorter One
Sunday night planning used to make me want to cry.

Now I just open Kairos and we're ready for Monday.

It keeps track of where we are in all our books. It lets me plan by rhythm instead of rigid schedules. And it actually understands that "behind" isn't a thing when you're building a life, not checking boxes.

Free to try - link in bio.

POV: You finally found a planner that doesn't make you feel like a failure for not finishing everything by Friday

Tell me you homeschool without telling me you homeschool:
*opens planner*
*sees 4 kids, 47 living books, and somehow it all makes sense*

## Facebook Group Post (Casual)

Hey mamas - I've been working on a digital planner and I'd love some honest feedback from real homeschool families.

It's called Kairos and it's built around rhythms instead of rigid schedules. You can track where you are in books, see what's on deck for each kiddo, and it actually works on your phone (because let's be real, I'm planning from the couch half the time).

It's completely free during beta - I just want to make it actually useful before I charge anything for it.

Would love if a few of you would try it and tell me what's missing or what's annoying. Link: https://palimpsest-275eb.web.app

(And yes, kairos is the Greek word for "the right moment" - because that's what I'm chasing instead of chronos/clock time.)
